                                <h3>My Childhood</h3>
                                <p align="justify">
                                    My first recollection of my childhood is the day I toppled down the stairs when 
                                    I was three years old. I was so upset that I cried and cried for nearly an hour 
                                    in spite of my parents' attempts at comforting me. Finally, I quietened down when 
                                    I was given ice-cream and chocolates. Luckily, I was not hurt.

                                </p>
                                <p align="justify">
                                    My days were happy ones before I started going to school, as I had good neighbour 
                                    to play with from morning till evening. We played games outdoors, There were also other games 
                                    to occupy our time. At the age of five years, I had to attend kindergarten and this turned out 
                                    to be quite an ordeal for me. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>My School Life</h3>
                                <p align="justify">
                                   It was a golden period of my life when I was a school-boy. For me sweet are the memories of the school-days. 
                                   Deep are the impressions of school-life and unforgettable are the experiences in schooldays. 
                                   On occasions the whole chart of memorable moments in school-life moves in front of my eyes. 
                                </p>
                                <p align="justify">
                                   When I memorise my school-life, I feel that once again became a child and experience my golden days. But alas! 
                                   It’s not possible. So I always carry in my mind the rich treasure of sweet memories of my school-life and share 
                                   it with my close friends who are my old class-mates.
                                </p>
                                <h3>My College Life</h3>
                                <p align="justify">
                                    The ideal college lifestyle dissipates quickly once the reality is reached. Many young adults imagine vivid pictures 
                                    of what college might be like for them. However, once these young adults mature into independent men and women, and enter 
                                    into the school of their choice, they soon realize the reality of the college lifestyle. They must learn to adapt to their 
                                    new surroundings as quickly as possible to accomplish the sought after degrees. Students come to the realization that life 
                                    is not as easy as they might hope for.
                                </p>
                                <p align="justify">
                                    Students quickly learn that many classes stretch into the nighttime hours. Often, students are not in classes with their friends,
                                    but with other students who sometimes can be old enough to be their parents. Although the average college age might be near 20 
                                    years old, it can range from 18 to 40 years old or older. There are many middle-aged adults going back to college to get their 
                                    degree at the same time the 18-year-old college student is going to start his or her degree.
                                </p>
                                <h3>My University Life</h3>
                                <p align="justify">
                                    The main reason for going to university is to get an academic qualification, but personally, I think that the social side of 
                                    things and developing as a person are equally important. The good thing about university life is that you are left to your own 
                                    devices, unlike school, where you're told what to do and how to do it. It's important to socialise and meet new friends. 
                                    lt takes some people longer than others. If a student has any problems, about anything, there's student counselling available 
                                    at all universities, where they try and help out as much as possible.
                                </p>
                                <p align="justify">
                                    It's great living in rented accommodation, but sometimes you can have problems with landlords. If you do have any, there's a 
                                    Student Welfare Service, which advises you on what to do if you have a problem.You have to learn to balance your academic work 
                                    and social life. At first, I spent too much time going out and hardly any time in the library. You learn from your mistakes and
                                    you soon learn how to balance it all.
                                </p>
